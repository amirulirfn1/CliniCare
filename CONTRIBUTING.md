# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CliniCare!

## Branching strategy
- The `main` branch contains production-ready code.
- Create dedicated feature branches from `main` for all work (`feature/<name>` or `bugfix/<name>`).
- Open a pull request to merge your branch back into `main` once work is complete.

## Commit messages
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the intent of the change.
- Break large changes into multiple commits when appropriate.

## Pull requests
- Provide a clear title and summary describing the change.
- Link related issues or discussions.
- Ensure all checks pass and request a review from a project maintainer.

## Branch protection and reviews
- Direct pushes to `main` are restricted; all changes must come through pull requests.
- Merging requires at least one approving review.
- Protected branches require all status checks to pass before merging.

Thank you for helping make CliniCare better!
